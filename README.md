# www-fini-net

Web site content for [https://www.fini.net/](https://www.fini.net/)

## Status

Rebuilding from the twiki/foswiki source code and turning it into a hugo site.
This is not currently the live site on [https://www.fini.net/](https://www.fini.net/)
but hopefully we will be live within a year.

It is viewable at [https://fini-net.github.io/www-fini-net/](https://fini-net.github.io/www-fini-net/),
but there's a lot that is still broken.

### Working

- Pull down fuller `justfile` from [www-chicks-net](https://github.com/chicks-net/www-chicks-net).
- Converted from TWiki (read the [notes](TWiki_Conversion_Notes.md))
- Generating with `hugo`
- GHA for `markdownlint`

## Code of Conduct

Please refer to the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to learn about our expectations for contributors.
I would guess the chances of collaboration on this repo are so small as to be unmeasurable,
but this is a trivial compliance thing to check off and I'm trying to get all of my repos closer
to best practices.
