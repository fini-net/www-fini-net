Please take the time to familiarize yourself with this policy.</p>
<p><strong>DOMAIN NAME DISPUTES.</strong>�You acknowledge having read and understood
and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the following
documents, as they may be amended from time to time, which are hereby
incorporated and made an integral part of this Agreement:&lt;p&gt;(i) The
Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (�Dispute Policy),
available at <a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp.htm">http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp.htm</a>;&lt;p&gt;(ii) The Start-Up
Dispute Resolution Policy (�SUDRP�), available at
<a href="http://www.neulevel.com/countdown/stop.html">http://www.neulevel.com/countdown/stop.html</a>; and&lt;p&gt;(iii) The
Restrictions Dispute Resolution Criteria and Rules (�RDRP�), available
at <a href="http://www.neulevel.com/">http://www.neulevel.com/</a>;&lt;p&gt;(collectively, �Dispute
Policies�).&lt;p&gt;The SUDRP sets forth the terms and conditions in
connection with a dispute between a registrant of a .biz domain name
(�Registrant�) with any third party (other than Neulevel, Inc.
(�Registry Operator�) or Tucows over the registration or use of a .biz
domain name registered by you that is subject to the Start-up
Intellectual Property Notification Service (�SIPNS�).� SIPNS is a
service introduced by Registry Operator to notify a trademark or service
mark holder (�Claimant�) that a second-level domain name has been
registered in which that Claimant claims intellectual property rights.�
In accordance with the SUDRP and its associated Rules, those Claimants
will have the right to challenge registrations through independent
ICANN-accredited dispute resolution providers.&lt;p&gt;The Dispute Policy
sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between
a Registrant and any party other than the Registry Operator or Registrar
over the registration and use of an Internet domain name registered by
Registrant.&lt;p&gt;he RDRP sets forth the terms under which any allegation
that a domain name is not used primarily for business or commercial
purposes shall be endorsed on a case-by-case, fact specific basis by an
independent ICANN-accredited dispute provider.&lt;p&gt; <strong>POLICY</strong>.� You
agree that your registration of the domain name shall be subject to
suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to any Tucows, Registry
Operator, ICANN or government-adopted policy, or pursuant to any
registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with an ICANN or
government-adopted policy, (1) to correct mistakes by us or the
applicable Registry in registering the name or (2) for the resolution of
disputes concerning the domain name.&lt;p&gt; <strong>AGENCY</strong>.� Should you intend
to license use of a domain name to a third party you shall nonetheless
be the domain name holder of record and are therefore responsible for
providing your own full contact information and for providing and
updating accurate technical and administrative contact information
adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in
connection with the domain name.� You shall accept liability for harm
caused by wrongful use of the domain name.� You represent that you have
provided notice of the terms and conditions in this Agreement to a third
party licensee and that the third party agrees to the terms hereof.</p>
<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>.� We reserve the right to distribute information to
you that is pertinent to the quality or operation of our services and
those of our service partners. These announcements will be predominately
informative in nature and may include notices describing changes,
upgrades, new products or other information to add security or to
enhance your identity on the Internet.&lt;p &ldquo;&gt; <strong>LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY</strong>.� You agree that our entire liability, and your exclusive
remedy, with respect to any Services(s) provided under this Agreement
and any breach of this Agreement is solely limited to the amount you
paid for such Service(s).� Neither we nor our contractors or third party
beneficiaries shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental,
special or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to
use any of the Services or for the cost of procurement of substitute
services.� Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such
jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the extent permitted by law.
We disclaim any and all loss or liability resulting from, but not
limited to: (1) loss or liability resulting from access delays or access
interruptions; (2) loss or liability resulting from data non-delivery or
data miss-delivery; (3) loss or liability resulting from acts of God;
(4) loss or liability resulting from the unauthorized use or misuse of
your account identifier or password; (5) loss or liability resulting
from errors, omissions, or misstatements in any and all information or
services(s) provided under this Agreement; (6) loss or liability
resulting from the interruption of your Service. You agree that we will
not be liable for any loss of registration and use of your domain name,
or for interruption of business, or any indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any kind (including lost profits) regardless
of the form of action whether in contract, tort (including negligence),
or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such
damages. In no event shall our maximum liability exceed five hundred
($500.00) dollars.&lt;p&gt; <strong>INDEMNITY.</strong>�You agree to release, indemnify,
and hold us, our contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors,
affiliates and third party beneficiaries harmless from all liabilities,
claims and expenses, including attorney&rsquo;s fees, of third parties
relating to or arising under this Agreement, the Services provided
hereunder or your use of the Services, including without limitation
infringement by you, or someone else using the Service of any
intellectual property or other proprietary right of any person or
entity, or from the violation of any of our operating rules or policy
relating to the Service(s) provided. You also agree to release,
indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions
contained in the Dispute Policy.� When we are threatened with suit by a
third party, we may seek written assurances from you concerning your
promise to indemnify us; your failure to provide those assurances shall
be a breach of your Agreement and may result in deactivation of your
domain name.&lt;p &ldquo;&gt; <strong>TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.</strong>� The person named as
Registrant at the time the user name and password are secured shall be
the owner of the domain name. You agree that prior to transferring
ownership of your domain name to another person (the Transferee&rdquo;) you
shall require the Transferee to agree in writing to be bound by all the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.� Your domain name will not be
transferred until we receive such written assurances or other reasonable
assurance that the Transferee has been bound by the contractual terms of
this Agreement (such reasonable assurance as determined by us in our
sole discretion) along with the applicable transfer fee.� If the
Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us
in our sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement,
any such transfer will be null and void.� You acknowledge that you will
not be entitled to change registrars during the first sixty (60) days
following the registration of your domain name.&lt;p&gt; <strong>BREACH.</strong>� You
agree that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any
operating rule or policy or the Dispute Policy provided by us, may be
considered by us to be a material breach and that we may provide a
written notice, describing the breach, to you.� If within thirty (30)
calendar days of the date of such notice, you fail to provide evidence,
which is reasonably satisfactory to us, that you have not breached your
obligations under the Agreement, then we may delete the registration or
reservation of your domain name. Any such breach by you shall not be
deemed to be excused simply because we did not act earlier in response
to that, or any other breach by you.&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p><strong>NO GUARANTY.</strong>� You acknowledge that registration or reservation of
your chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to
either the registration, reservation, or use of the domain name.</p>

accurate. You are obliged to provide us the following
information:&lt;p&gt;(i) Your name and postal address (or, if different,
that of the domain name holder);&lt;p&gt;(ii) The domain name being

DISCLOSURE AND USE OF REGISTRATION INFORMATION.** You agree and
acknowledge that we will make domain name registration information you

which we describe in this Agreement.&lt;p&gt;We will take reasonable
precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from our loss,
misuse, unauthorized accessor disclosure, alteration or destruction of
that information.&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p><strong>REVOCATION.</strong>� Your wilful provision of inaccurate or unreliable
information, your wilful failure promptly to update information provided
to us, or your failure to respond for over fifteen (15) calendar days to
inquiries by us concerning the accuracy of contact details associated
with the your registration shall constitute a material breach of this
Agreement and be a basis for cancellation of the domain name
registration. &lt;p&gt; <strong>RIGHT OF REFUSAL</strong>.� We, and/or Registry Operator,
in our sole discretion, reserve the right to refuse to register or
reserve your chosen domain name or register you for other Services.� In
the event we do not register or reserve your domain name or register you
for other Services, or we delete your domain name or other Services
within such thirty (30) calendar day period, we agree to refund your
applicable fee(s).� You agree that we shall not be liable to you for
loss or damages that may result from our refusal to register, reserve,
or delete your domain name or register you for other Services.&lt;p&gt;We
reserve the right to delete or transfer your domain name following
registration if we believe the registration has been made possible by a
mistake, made either by us or by a third party.� We also reserve the
right to suspend a domain name during resolution of a dispute.&lt;p&gt; **
SEVERABILITY**.� You agree that the terms of this Agreement are
severable.� If any term or provision is declared invalid or
unenforceable, that term or provision will be construed consistent with
applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions
of the parties, and the remaining terms and provisions will remain in
full force and effect.&lt;p&gt; <strong>NON-AGENCY</strong>.� Nothing contained in this
Agreement or the Dispute Policies shall be construed as creating any
agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the
parties.&lt;p&gt; <strong>NON-WAIVER.</strong>�Our failure to require performance by
you of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require
such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by us of a
breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the
provision itself. &lt;p&gt;</p>
