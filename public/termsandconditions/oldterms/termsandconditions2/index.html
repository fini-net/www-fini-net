<p>3 December 1998</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND ACCEPTABLE USE GUIDELINES
CAREFULLY BEFORE OPENING OR CONTINUING AN ACCOUNT WITH Flamingo Internet
Navigators (hereafter referred to as FINI). These Terms, Conditions and
Acceptable Use Guidelines represent the complete Agreement and
understanding between FINI and you, the FINI account holder, and
supersede any other written or oral agreement pertaining to your FINI
services. By using FINI services, you agree to be bound by and to comply
with this Agreement, just as if you had signed it. Violation of any
provision of this Agreement is grounds for immediate termination of your
FINI account.</p>
<p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD
IMMEDIATELY END YOUR USE OF FINI SERVICES AND NOTIFY FINI SO THAT FINI
MAY INITIATE CLOSURE OF YOUR ACCOUNT.</strong></p>
<p>FINI may be contacted by email at &lt;a class=link
href=&quot;<a href="mailto:support@fini.net">mailto:support@fini.net</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="mailto:support@fini.net">support@fini.net</a>&lt;/a&gt;
or by regular mail at:</p>
<p>Flamingo Internet Navigators&lt;br /&gt; 310-D Patriot Lane&lt;br /&gt;
Williamsburg, VA 23185-2055</p>
<p>FINI reserves the right to modify the Terms, Conditions and Acceptable
Use Guidelines, and/or modify the prices of its services, as well as
discontinue or change the services offered. A notification will be made
by email when modifications are made, however, it will be the
responsibility of the account holder to keep informed about these
changes. Your continued use of FINI&rsquo;s services following such
notification will be deemed acceptance of the modification.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.00 Provision of Services</strong></em></p>
<p>1.01 This Agreement defines the terms, conditions, and acceptable use
for all types of accounts offered by FINI. FINI &ldquo;services&rdquo; are defined
as the use of computing, telecommunications, software, and information
services provided by FINI. These services also include the provision of
access to computing, telecommunications, software and information
services provided by others via the global Internet.</p>
<p>1.02 FINI will provide services on its computing systems to you in
exchange for recurring payment of subscription fees and full compliance
with this agreement.</p>
<p>1.03 FINI reserves the right to discontinue any and all services to you
at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any conduct which
FINI, in its sole discretion, believes violates these Terms, Conditions
and Acceptable Use Guidelines, or is otherwise harmful to FINI&rsquo;s
interests or the interests of other account holders.</p>
<p>1.04 You may use FINI&rsquo;s services for lawful purposes, in compliance with
all applicable laws including copyright and trademark law. Unlawful
activities include storing, distributing or transmitting any unlawful
material through FINI services, attempting to compromise the security of
any Internet account or site, or making direct threats of physical harm.</p>
<p>1.05 To comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to
operate its systems properly, or to protect itself or its account
holders, FINI reserves the right to access and disclose any information.
This may include disclosing the usernames of accounts and other
information. FINI will fully cooperate with law enforcement authorities
in investigating suspected lawbreakers, and reserves the right to report
to law enforcement any suspected illegal activity it becomes aware of.</p>
<p>1.06 When FINI becomes aware of possible violations of this Agreement,
FINI may, in its sole discretion, choose to initiate an investigation.
This investigation may include gathering information from account
holders and examining material on FINI&rsquo;s servers. During investigations,
FINI may suspend accounts involved in a violation and/or remove the
material involved from its servers. If FINI believes, in its sole
discretion, that a violation of this Agreement has occurred, it may
temporarily or permanently remove material from FINI servers, warn the
account holder(s) involved, suspend or terminate the account(s)
responsible, and take other responsive action. FINI, in its sole
discretion, will determine what action will be taken in response to a
violation on a case-by-case basis. Violations of this Agreement could
also subject you to criminal or civil liability.</p>
<p>1.07 You are responsible for obtaining the Internet access required to
connect to FINI services, including computer hardware, software and
Internet access provider services. FINI does not provide Internet access
services, hardware or software. You are responsible for ensuring that
such equipment or service is compatible with FINI&rsquo;s requirements. These
requirements include conformance to the appropriate Internet Request for
Comments (RFC&rsquo;s). RFC&rsquo;s can be obtained from &lt;a class=link
href=&quot;<a href="ftp://ftp.chicks.net/pub/rfc/std/">ftp://ftp.chicks.net/pub/rfc/std/</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="ftp://ftp.chicks.net/pub/rfc/std/">ftp://ftp.chicks.net/pub/rfc/std/</a>&lt;/a&gt;
as well as other public archives such as &lt;a class=link
href=&quot;<a href="http://www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org/</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="http://www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org/</a>&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
<p>1.08 Any use of FINI scripts or software or third-party scripts or
software distributed by FINI is governed by the End-user License
Agreement that accompanies such scripts or software. Use of such
software indicates your acceptance of the terms therein.</p>
<p>1.09 Certain services performed by FINI may require passing personal
information about FINI account holders to third parties. Services
include, but are not limited to, registering information with the
<a href="InterNIC" title="wikilink">InterNIC</a>, ARIN, or other registries for those
account holders who wish to own their own Internet domain name. FINI can
not be held responsible for the lack of privacy that these third party
entities may offer.</p>
<p>1.10 FINI reserves the right to obtain, lease and utilize the products
and services of third party vendors in order to maintain services to
account holders. Examples of services may include, but are not limited
to, Internet connections, Internet servers, or any other product or
service that FINI deems necessary to maintain services to its account
holders.</p>
<p>1.11 <strong>Tariffs</strong>: Services will be provided under FINI Tariffs, subject
to the rates, terms and conditions in such tariffs as well as the
contract tariffs (&ldquo;CT&rdquo;), if applicable, (collectively &ldquo;Applicable
Tariffs&rdquo;), as those Applicable Tariffs may be modified from time to
time. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this form
(including its addenda, if any) and the FINI Tariffs, the terms of the
FINI Tariffs shall prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between
the terms of the CT, if applicable, and the FINI Tariffs, the terms of
the CT, shall prevail. Except for changes to the Applicable Tariffs, no
change, modification or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement
shall be binding unless reduced to writing and signed by an authorized
representative of both parties and to the extent required by law, filed
with the FCC. If FINI voluntarily or involuntarily as a result of
government action cancels, in whole or in part, any Tariff(s) referenced
herein, then effective on such cancellation, service will be provided
thereafter in accordance with FINI Tariff(s) which remain in effect as
amended from time to time and which will be provided to Customer on
request.</p>
<p>1.12 <strong>Agency Authorization.</strong> The customer authorizes FINI to act as
agent for Customer as necessary, pursuant to the Letter of
Authorization, to provide the Service, including but not limited to,
ordering telecommunications and other services or facilities and
increasing, adding to, terminating, decreasing, removing or rearranging
such service or facilities on Customer&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>1.13 <strong>Facilities.</strong> The furnishing of service under this Agreement is
subject to the availability on a continuing basis of all necessary
facilities and is limited to the capacity of FINI&rsquo;s facilities, and/or
that of FINI&rsquo;s underlying carriers. Without the specific consent of
FINI, Customer shall have no right of access to the facilities or any
other real or personal property of FINI and shall refrain from any
contact whatsoever with said facilities and/or other FINI property.</p>
<p>1.14. <strong>Equipment &amp; Location.</strong> If facilities and / or equipment are a
part of the Customer&rsquo;s services provided under this Agreement, the
Customer will not allow unreasonably or cause any facility or equipment
of FINI or FINI providers to be rearranged, moved, modified, damaged,
repaired, or relocated without FINI&rsquo;s consent. Customer shall be
responsible for ensuring that the equipment, wiring, space, and
associated facilities, conduit and rights-of-way are protected against
fire, theft, vandalism, or other casualty and that the use thereof
complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and contractual
obligations. Customer will not create or allow any liens or other
encumbrances to be placed on any such facilities or equipment of FINI or
FINI Providers. If Customer relocates or changes the place of the
Service provided under any Service Order, Customer will pay all
additional installation and related charges associated with such
relocation. All FINI equipment or FINI provider equipment shall be
returned to FINI upon termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.00 Payment of fees</strong></em></p>
<p>2.01 Current recurring and setup fees for FINI services can be found on
the Web on the FINI web site found at &lt;a class=link
href=&quot;<a href="http://www.fini.net">http://www.fini.net</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="http://www.fini.net">http://www.fini.net</a>&lt;/a&gt; FINI will
publish an online notice of fee increases at least 30 days before such
increases take effect.</p>
<p>2.02 FINI services are offered on a prepay basis. Payment for a minimum
of one quarter of services must be received prior to the quarter&rsquo;s start
date. Accounts that do not abide to the payment terms set forth herein
are subject to suspension and/or account termination. You acknowledge
responsibility that, even if your account is terminated, you will be
held liable for any balance owed on the account.</p>
<p>2.03 Acceptable means of payment include Cash, Personal Check, Cashier&rsquo;s
Check, and Corporate Account Checks. Payment for a FINI account or
service by fraudulent means will result in immediate and permanent
termination of the account, and possible criminal penalties.</p>
<p>2.04 FINI reserves the right to charge a setup fee to reinstate
suspended or terminated accounts.</p>
<p>2.05 <strong>There is a $25.00 service charge for each returned check</strong>.</p>
<p>2.06 If you believe FINI has billed you incorrectly, you must contact
FINI no later than 30 days after the date on the first billing statement
in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an
adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to FINI&rsquo;s Billing
Department (&lt;a class=link
href=&quot;<a href="mailto:billing@fini.net">mailto:billing@fini.net</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="mailto:billing@fini.net">billing@fini.net</a>&lt;/a&gt;),
and should include all available information about the suspected error.</p>
<p>2.07 Usage charges, if applicable, will be billed in arrears, and
rounded up to the next whole cent. In the event FINI is unable to record
usage for any part of a billing period, FINI shall be entitled to make a
reasonable estimate of Customer&rsquo;s usage of services for that billing
period. Customer will pay all invoices within ten (10) days after the
invoice date and shall send its payments to the address specified on the
invoice. FINI may, in addition, to any other remedies available to it,
impose a late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per
month on any invoice not paid within such 10-day period. Failure of
Customer to receive any invoice in no way relieves Customer of the
obligation to pay for any rendered services.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.00 Cancellation and Termination</strong></em></p>
<p>3.01 To cancel your account, you must contact FINI support via email or
postal mail. Cancellation requests must include the account&rsquo;s login
name, and your name, address and phone number and other identifying
information as they appear in FINI&rsquo;s billing records. If the information
provided to FINI for an account does not match the account&rsquo;s records,
cancellation may be delayed or prevented. Accounts cannot be canceled
over the phone.</p>
<p>3.02 All cancellation requests must be received by 1:00 PM Eastern
Standard Time on a regular business day to be processed the same day.
Otherwise, your request may not be processed until the following
business day.</p>
<p>3.03 All FINI accounts must be paid in full before a cancellation will
be considered complete. Unused time will not be pro-rated.</p>
<p>3.04 If a FINI account is canceled, suspended or terminated, FINI may
maintain the account for 30 days. You may contact FINI within that time
to inquire about reopening a suspended account, or forwarding mail or
files to another address. FINI reserves the right to refuse to forward
the mail and/or files of any account terminated for violation of any
provision of the Terms, Conditions and Acceptable Use Guidelines. If you
do not contact FINI within 30 days, your account and associated files
will be deleted from FINI&rsquo;s servers, and FINI will not be able to reopen
it or restore files. FINI is not responsible for maintaining material
that it deletes from its servers as a result of a determination that the
