  "articleBody": "Exhibit A Registration Agreement 1. IN THIS REGISTRATION AGREEMENT (“Agreement”), “Registrant”, “you” and “your” refers to the Registrant of each domain name registration, “we”, “us\" and “our” refers to Tucows.com Co., and “Services” refers to the domain name registration services provided by us as offered through Flamingo Internet Navigators, (FINI), the Registration Service Provider (“Reseller”). Any reference to a “registry,” “Registry” or “Registry Operator” shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable TLD or ccTLD. This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and explains your obligations to us for the Services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the rules and regulations set forth by a registry for that particular registry only. 2. SELECTION OF A DOMAIN NAME. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee that you will obtain a desired domain name registration, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at the time of your application for same. You represent that, to the best of the your knowledge and belief, neither the registration of the domain name nor the manner in which it is directly or indirectly to be used, infringes upon the legal rights of a third party and further, that the domain name is not being registered for nor shall it at any time whatsoever be used for any unlawful purpose. During the period following registration of a domain name and the appointment of active name servers, we may post a stagnant web page and any revenues generated from same shall be for our own account. 3. FEES. As consideration for the Services, you agree to pay Reseller the applicable service(s) fees prior to the effectiveness of a desired domain name registration or any renewal thereof. All fees payable hereunder are non-refundable even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your current registration term. As further consideration for the Services, you agree to: (1) provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you as required by the registration process, and (2) maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate. All such information shall be referred to as account information (“Account Information”). You represent that the Account Information and all other statements put forth in your application are true, complete and accurate. Both Tucows and each registry reserves the right to terminate your domain name registration if: (i) information provided by you or your agent is false, inaccurate, incomplete, unreliable, misleading or otherwise secretive; or (ii) you have failed to maintain, update and keep your Account Information true, current, complete, accurate and reliable. You acknowledge that a breach of this Section 3 will constitute a material breach of our Agreement, which will entitle either us or a registry to terminate this Agreement immediately upon such breach without any refund and without notice to you. 4. TERM. This Agreement will remain in effect during the term of your domain name registration as selected, recorded and paid for at the time of registration or any renewal thereof. Should the domain name be transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall cease.\n5. MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT. You acknowledge that the practice of registering and administering domain names is constantly evolving; therefore, you agree that Tucows may modify this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement, as is necessary to comply with its agreements with ICANN, a registry or any other entity or individual, as well as to adjust to changing circumstances. All amendments to this Agreement will be posted on our website. Your continued use of the domain name registered to you will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement with any revisions. If you do not agree to any change, you may request that your domain name registration be cancelled or transferred to a different accredited registrar. You agree that such cancellation or request for transfer will be your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to abide by any change to this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement. 6. MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR ACCOUNT. In order to change any of your account information with us, you must use the Account Identifier and Password that you selected when you opened your account with us. You agree to safeguard your Account Identifier and Password from any unauthorized use. In no event shall we be liable for the unauthorized use or misuse of your Account Identifier or Password. 7. NO GUARANTY. You acknowledge that registration or reservation of your chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to the registration, reservation or use of the domain name. 8. DOMAIN NAME DISPUTES. You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the dispute policy adopted by the applicable registry. You agree that in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable policy. If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding your domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, suspend your ability to use your domain name or to make modifications to your registration records until (i) Tucows is directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body, or (ii) Tucows receives notification by you and the other party contesting your domain that the dispute has been settled. Furthermore, you agree that if you are subject to litigation regarding your registration or use of your domain name, Tucows may deposit control of your registration record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a party with a registrar certificate from us. 9. POLICY. You agree that your registration of the domain name shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, or pursuant to any registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with a Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, (1) to correct mistakes by us or a registry in registering the name or (2) for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.\n10. AGENCY. Should you intend to license use of a domain name to a third party you shall nonetheless be the domain name holder of record and are therefore responsible for providing your own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name. You shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name. You represent that you will secure the agreement of any third party to the terms and conditions in this Agreement 11. ANNOUNCEMENTS. We reserve the right to distribute information to you that is pertinent to the quality or operation of our services and those of our service partners. These announcements will be predominately informative in nature and may include notices describing changes, upgrades, new products or other information to add security or to enhance your identity on the Internet. 12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. You agree that our entire liability, and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any Services(s) provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is solely limited to the amount you paid for the initial registration of your domain name. Tucows and its directors, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents and third party providers, ICANN and the applicable registries shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use any of the Services or for the cost of procurement of substitute services. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, our liability is limited to the extent permitted by law. We disclaim any and all loss or liability resulting from, but not limited to: (1) loss or liability resulting from access delays or access interruptions; (2) loss or liability resulting from data non-delivery or data mis-delivery; (3) loss or liability resulting from acts of God; (4) loss or liability resulting from the unauthorized use or misuse of your account identifier or password; (5) loss or liability resulting from errors, omissions, or misstatements in any and all information or services(s) provided under this Agreement; (6) loss or liability resulting from the interruption of your Service. You agree that we will not be liable for any loss of registration and use of your domain name, or for interruption of business, or any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind (including lost profits) regardless of the form of action whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. 13. INDEMNITY. You agree to release, indemnify, and hold Tucows, its contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors and affiliates, ICANN, the applicable registries and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney’s fees, of third parties arising out of or relating to the registration or use of the domain name registered in your name, whether used by yourself, licensed to a third party or pursuant to the Whois Privacy Service, including without limitation infringement by you or a third party with access to your Account Identifier and Password. You also agree to release, indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable Dispute Policy. When we are threatened with suit by a third party, we may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to indemnify us; your failure to provide those assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in the suspension or cancellation of your domain name. This indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. 14. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP. The person named as Registrant on the Whois shall be the registered name holder. The person named as Administrative contact at the time the controlling Account Identifier and Password are secured, shall be deemed the designate of the Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name. You agree that prior to transferring ownership of your domain name to another person (the “Transferee\") you shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us in our sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void. 15. RENEWALS AND FORFEITURE. Domain names are registered for a finite period of time. You will receive reminders immediately prior to the expiration of your registration inviting you to renew your domain name. In the event that you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, your registration will expire and we may, at our discretion, elect to assume the registration and may hold it for our own account, delete it or we may sell it to a third party. You acknowledge and agree that your right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration and that any expired domain name may be made available for registration by a third party. If you fail to renew your registration, your domain name may cease to resolve and visitors to your site may be redirected to a default page informing them that the site is no longer in service. This parked or default page may feature advertisements posted by us for our own account. If we have elected to renew the registration, you will be entitled to a grace period during which you may re-register the domain name from us. Additional costs may apply. During this grace period, we may post a parked page and/or may revise the “Whois” registration records to include either our information or that of your Reseller. The domain name may also be listed for auction. If the name is sold during any such auction, it will be acquired by a third party on a provisional basis and will remain available for re-registration by you during our stated grace period. If you do not re-register the domain name during the grace period, the auction sale will be concluded and you will receive a share of the proceeds received from the new registrant. Tucows will send an email to the last address you have provided advising you of the sale and your interest in same. At present, we agree to pay you forty (40) per cent of the net proceeds of any such auction. You will have one (1) year following the issue of the email to claim your share of the proceeds. Any amounts not claimed within one (1) year will be deemed to have been abandoned by you and will be deposited by us for our own account. If you fail to renew your domain name registration during the grace period, you acknowledge that you have abandoned the domain name and that it is available for sale and registration by any third party. 16. BREACH. You agree that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any operating rule or policy or the Dispute Policy provided by us, may be considered by us to be a material breach and that we may provide a written notice, describing the breach, to you. If within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of such notice, you fail to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to us, that you have not breached your obligations under the Agreement, then we may delete the registration or reservation of your domain name. Any such breach by you shall not be deemed to be excused simply because we did not act earlier in response to that, or any other breach by you. 17. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. You agree that your use of our Services is solely at your own risk. You agree that such Service(s) is provided on an “as is,” “as available” basis. We expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We make no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements, or that the Service(s) will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free; nor do we make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service(s) or as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the Service or that defects in the Service will be corrected. You understand and agree that any material and/or data downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of Service is done at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of such material and/or data. We make no warranty regarding any goods or services purchased or obtained through the Service or any transactions entered into through the Service. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through the Service shall create any warranty not expressly made herein. 18. INFORMATION. As part of the registration process, you are required to provide us certain information and to update us promptly as such information changes such that our records are current, complete and accurate. You are obliged to provide us the following information:\n(a) your name and postal address (or, if different, that of the domain name holder); (b)\nthe domain name being registered; (c) the name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the administrative contact for the domain name; (d) the name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the billing contact for the domain name; and (e) the name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the technical contact for the domain name. Any voluntary information we request is collected in order that we can continue to improve the products and services offered to you through your Reseller. 19. DISCLOSURE AND USE OF REGISTRATION INFORMATION. You agree and acknowledge that we will make domain name registration information you provide available to ICANN, to the registry administrators, law enforcement agencies and to other third parties as applicable. You further agree and acknowledge that we may make publicly available, or directly available to third party vendors, some or all, of the domain name registration information you provide, for purposes of inspection (such as through our Whois service) or other purposes as required or permitted by ICANN and applicable laws. (a) You hereby consent to any and all such disclosures and use of, and guidelines, limits and restrictions on disclosure or use of, information provided by you in connection with the registration of a domain name (including any updates to such information), whether during or after the term of your registration of the domain name. You hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of your domain name registration information by us. (b) You may access your domain name registration information in our possession to review, modify or update such information, by accessing our domain manager service, or similar service, made available by us through your Reseller. (c)\nWe will not process or maintain data about any identified or identifiable natural person that we obtain from you in a way incompatible with the purposes and other limitations which we describe in this Agreement. (d) We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from our loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information. 20. OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN WHOIS. Your wilful provision of inaccurate or unreliable information, your wilful failure promptly to update information provided to us, or any failure to respond to inquiries by us addressed to the email address of the registrant, the administrative, billing or technical contact appearing in the Whois directory with respect to a domain name concerning the accuracy of contact details associated with the registration shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and be a basis for cancellation of the domain name registration. Any information collected by us concerning an identified or identifiable natural person (“Personal Data”) will be used in connection with the registration of your domain name(s) and for the purposes of this Agreement and as required or permitted by ICANN or an applicable registry policy. 21. REVOCATION. We, in our sole discretion, reserve the right to deny, cancel, suspend, transfer or modify any domain name registration to correct a mistake, protect the integrity and stability of the company and any applicable registry, to comply with any applicable laws, government rules, or requirements, requests of law enforcement, in compliance with any dispute resolution process, or to avoid any liability, civil or criminal. You agree that we shall not be liable to you for loss or damages that may result from our refusal to register or cancel, suspend, transfer or modify your domain name registration. 22. INCONSISTENCIES WITH REGISTRY POLICIES. In the event that this Agreement may be inconsistent with any term, condition, policy or procedure of an applicable registry, the term, condition, policy or procedure of the applicable registry shall prevail.\n23. NON-WAIVER. Our failure to require performance by you of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by us of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. 24. NOTICES. Any notice, direction or other communication given under this Agreement shall be in writing and given by sending it via e-mail or via regular mail.

  <div class="post-content"><p>&lt;div align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;&gt;<strong>Exhibit A &lt;BR&gt; Registration
Agreement</strong>&lt;/div&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>1. <strong>IN THIS REGISTRATION AGREEMENT</strong> (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;), “Registrant”,
&ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; refers to the Registrant of each domain name
registration, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, “us&quot; and &ldquo;our&rdquo; refers to Tucows.com Co., and
“Services” refers to the domain name registration services provided by
us as offered through Flamingo Internet Navigators, (FINI), the
Registration Service Provider (“Reseller”). Any reference to a
“registry,” “Registry” or “Registry Operator” shall refer to the
registry administrator of the applicable TLD or ccTLD. This Agreement
explains our obligations to you, and explains your obligations to us for
the Services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the rules and
regulations set forth by a registry for that particular registry only.
&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>2. <strong>SELECTION OF A DOMAIN NAME.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that we
cannot guarantee that you will obtain a desired domain name
registration, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is
available at the time of your application for same. You represent that,
to the best of the your knowledge and belief, neither the registration
of the domain name nor the manner in which it is directly or indirectly
to be used, infringes upon the legal rights of a third party and
further, that the domain name is not being registered for nor shall it
at any time whatsoever be used for any unlawful purpose. During the
period following registration of a domain name and the appointment of
active name servers, we may post a stagnant web page and any revenues
generated from same shall be for our own account. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>3. <strong>FEES.</strong> As consideration for the Services, you agree to pay
Reseller the applicable service(s) fees prior to the effectiveness of a
desired domain name registration or any renewal thereof. All fees
payable hereunder are non-refundable even if your domain name
registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of
your current registration term. As further consideration for the
Services, you agree to: (1) provide certain current, complete and
accurate information about you as required by the registration process,
and (2) maintain and update this information as needed to keep it
current, complete and accurate. All such information shall be referred
to as account information (&ldquo;Account Information&rdquo;). You represent that
the Account Information and all other statements put forth in your
application are true, complete and accurate. Both Tucows and each
registry reserves the right to terminate your domain name registration
if: (i) information provided by you or your agent is false, inaccurate,
incomplete, unreliable, misleading or otherwise secretive; or (ii) you
have failed to maintain, update and keep your Account Information true,
current, complete, accurate and reliable. You acknowledge that a breach
of this Section 3 will constitute a material breach of our Agreement,
which will entitle either us or a registry to terminate this Agreement
immediately upon such breach without any refund and without notice to
you. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>4. <strong>TERM.</strong> This Agreement will remain in effect during the term of
your domain name registration as selected, recorded and paid for at the
time of registration or any renewal thereof. Should the domain name be
transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall cease.</p>
<p>&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>5. <strong>MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT.</strong> You acknowledge that the practice of
registering and administering domain names is constantly evolving;
therefore, you agree that Tucows may modify this Agreement, or any other
related and/or applicable agreement, as is necessary to comply with its
agreements with ICANN, a registry or any other entity or individual, as
well as to adjust to changing circumstances. All amendments to this
Agreement will be posted on our website. Your continued use of the
domain name registered to you will constitute your acceptance of this
Agreement with any revisions. If you do not agree to any change, you may
request that your domain name registration be cancelled or transferred
to a different accredited registrar. You agree that such cancellation or
request for transfer will be your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to
abide by any change to this Agreement, or any other related and/or
applicable agreement. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>6. <strong>MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.</strong> In order to change any of your
account information with us, you must use the Account Identifier and
Password that you selected when you opened your account with us. You
agree to safeguard your Account Identifier and Password from any
unauthorized use. In no event shall we be liable for the unauthorized
use or misuse of your Account Identifier or Password. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>7. <strong>NO GUARANTY.</strong> You acknowledge that registration or reservation of
your chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to the
registration, reservation or use of the domain name. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>8. <strong>DOMAIN NAME DISPUTES.</strong> You agree that, if the registration or
reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will
be subject to the provisions specified in the dispute policy adopted by
the applicable registry. You agree that in the event a domain name
dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us
harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the
applicable policy. If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed
with a judicial or administrative body regarding your domain name,
Tucows may, at its sole discretion, suspend your ability to use your
domain name or to make modifications to your registration records until
(i) Tucows is directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body,
or (ii) Tucows receives notification by you and the other party
contesting your domain that the dispute has been settled. Furthermore,
you agree that if you are subject to litigation regarding your
registration or use of your domain name, Tucows may deposit control of
your registration record into the registry of the judicial body by
supplying a party with a registrar certificate from us. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>9. <strong>POLICY.</strong> You agree that your registration of the domain name
shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to a
Tucows, registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, or pursuant to any
registrar or registry procedure not inconsistent with a Tucows,
registry, ICANN or government-adopted policy, (1) to correct mistakes by
us or a registry in registering the name or (2) for the resolution of
disputes concerning the domain name.</p>
<p>&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>10. <strong>AGENCY.</strong> Should you intend to license use of a domain name to a
third party you shall nonetheless be the domain name holder of record
and are therefore responsible for providing your own full contact
information and for providing and updating accurate technical and
administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely
resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain
name. You shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the
domain name. You represent that you will secure the agreement of any
third party to the terms and conditions in this Agreement &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>11. <strong>ANNOUNCEMENTS.</strong> We reserve the right to distribute information
to you that is pertinent to the quality or operation of our services and
those of our service partners. These announcements will be predominately
informative in nature and may include notices describing changes,
upgrades, new products or other information to add security or to
enhance your identity on the Internet. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>12. <strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong> You agree that our entire liability,
and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any Services(s) provided
under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is solely limited
to the amount you paid for the initial registration of your domain name.
Tucows and its directors, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents
and third party providers, ICANN and the applicable registries shall not
be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential
damages resulting from the use or inability to use any of the Services
or for the cost of procurement of substitute services. Because some
states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for
consequential or incidental damages, in such states, our liability is
limited to the extent permitted by law. We disclaim any and all loss or
liability resulting from, but not limited to: (1) loss or liability
resulting from access delays or access interruptions; (2) loss or
liability resulting from data non-delivery or data mis-delivery; (3)
loss or liability resulting from acts of God; (4) loss or liability
resulting from the unauthorized use or misuse of your account identifier
or password; (5) loss or liability resulting from errors, omissions, or
misstatements in any and all information or services(s) provided under
this Agreement; (6) loss or liability resulting from the interruption of
your Service. You agree that we will not be liable for any loss of
registration and use of your domain name, or for interruption of
business, or any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
of any kind (including lost profits) regardless of the form of action
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if
we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>13. <strong>INDEMNITY.</strong> You agree to release, indemnify, and hold Tucows,
its contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors and affiliates,
ICANN, the applicable registries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and affiliates harmless from all
liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney&rsquo;s fees, of third
parties arising out of or relating to the registration or use of the
domain name registered in your name, whether used by yourself, licensed
to a third party or pursuant to the Whois Privacy Service, including
without limitation infringement by you or a third party with access to
your Account Identifier and Password. You also agree to release,
indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions
contained in the applicable Dispute Policy. When we are threatened with
suit by a third party, we may seek written assurances from you
concerning your promise to indemnify us; your failure to provide those
assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of your Agreement and
may result in the suspension or cancellation of your domain name. This
indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of
this Agreement. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>14. <strong>TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.</strong> The person named as Registrant on the
Whois shall be the registered name holder. The person named as
Administrative contact at the time the controlling Account Identifier
and Password are secured, shall be deemed the designate of the
Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name. You agree that
prior to transferring ownership of your domain name to another person
(the “Transferee&quot;) you shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing
to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the
Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us
in our sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement,
any such transfer will be null and void. &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>15. <strong>RENEWALS AND FORFEITURE.</strong> Domain names are registered for a
finite period of time. You will receive reminders immediately prior to
the expiration of your registration inviting you to renew your domain
name. In the event that you fail to renew your domain name in a timely
fashion, your registration will expire and we may, at our discretion,
elect to assume the registration and may hold it for our own account,
delete it or we may sell it to a third party. You acknowledge and agree
that your right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration
and that any expired domain name may be made available for registration
by a third party. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; If you fail to renew your registration,
your domain name may cease to resolve and visitors to your site may be
redirected to a default page informing them that the site is no longer
in service. This parked or default page may feature advertisements
posted by us for our own account. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; If we have elected to
renew the registration, you will be entitled to a grace period during
which you may re-register the domain name from us. Additional costs may
apply. During this grace period, we may post a parked page and/or may
revise the “Whois” registration records to include either our
information or that of your Reseller. The domain name may also be listed
for auction. If the name is sold during any such auction, it will be
acquired by a third party on a provisional basis and will remain
available for re-registration by you during our stated grace period. If
you do not re-register the domain name during the grace period, the
auction sale will be concluded and you will receive a share of the
proceeds received from the new registrant. Tucows will send an email to
the last address you have provided advising you of the sale and your
interest in same. At present, we agree to pay you forty (40) per cent of
the net proceeds of any such auction. You will have one (1) year
following the issue of the email to claim your share of the proceeds.
Any amounts not claimed within one (1) year will be deemed to have been
abandoned by you and will be deposited by us for our own account. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt; If you fail to renew your domain name registration during the
grace period, you acknowledge that you have abandoned the domain name
and that it is available for sale and registration by any third party.
&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>16. <strong>BREACH.</strong> You agree that failure to abide by any provision of
this Agreement, any operating rule or policy or the Dispute Policy
provided by us, may be considered by us to be a material breach and that
we may provide a written notice, describing the breach, to you. If
within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of such notice, you fail to
provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to us, that you have
not breached your obligations under the Agreement, then we may delete
the registration or reservation of your domain name. Any such breach by
you shall not be deemed to be excused simply because we did not act
earlier in response to that, or any other breach by you. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>17. <strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</strong> You agree that your use of our
Services is solely at your own risk. You agree that such Service(s) is
provided on an &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. We expressly disclaim all
warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not
limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose and non-infringement. We make no warranty that the
Services will meet your requirements, or that the Service(s) will be
uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free; nor do we make any
warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the
Service(s) or as to the accuracy or reliability of any information
obtained through the Service or that defects in the Service will be
corrected. You understand and agree that any material and/or data
downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of Service is done at
your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for
any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the
download of such material and/or data. We make no warranty regarding any
goods or services purchased or obtained through the Service or any
transactions entered into through the Service. No advice or information,
whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through the Service
shall create any warranty not expressly made herein. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>18. <strong>INFORMATION.</strong> As part of the registration process, you are
required to provide us certain information and to update us promptly as
such information changes such that our records are current, complete and
accurate. You are obliged to provide us the following information:</p>

valign=&ldquo;top&rdquo;&gt;(e)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;the name, postal address, e-mail address,
and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the technical
contact for the domain name.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/table&gt; Any voluntary information we request is collected in order
that we can continue to improve the products and services offered to you
through your Reseller. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>19. <strong>DISCLOSURE AND USE OF REGISTRATION INFORMATION.</strong> You agree and
acknowledge that we will make domain name registration information you
provide available to ICANN, to the registry administrators, law
enforcement agencies and to other third parties as applicable. You
further agree and acknowledge that we may make publicly available, or
directly available to third party vendors, some or all, of the domain
name registration information you provide, for purposes of inspection
(such as through our Whois service) or other purposes as required or
permitted by ICANN and applicable laws. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;table border=&ldquo;0&rdquo;
cellpadding=&ldquo;5&rdquo;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td valign=&ldquo;top&rdquo; width=&ldquo;28&rdquo;&gt;(a)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td
width=&ldquo;693&rdquo;&gt;You hereby consent to any and all such disclosures and use
of, and guidelines, limits and restrictions on disclosure or use of,
information provided by you in connection with the registration of a
domain name (including any updates to such information), whether during
or after the term of your registration of the domain name. You hereby
irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have
arising from such disclosure or use of your domain name registration
information by us. &lt;/td&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td valign=&ldquo;top&rdquo;&gt;(b)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;You may access your
domain name registration information in our possession to review, modify
or update such information, by accessing our domain manager service, or
similar service, made available by us through your Reseller.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td valign=&ldquo;top&rdquo;&gt;(c)&lt;/td&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;td&gt;We will not process or maintain data about any identified or
identifiable natural person that we obtain from you in a way
incompatible with the purposes and other limitations which we describe
in this Agreement.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td valign=&ldquo;top&rdquo;&gt;(d)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we
obtain from you from our loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure,
alteration or destruction of that information.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>20. <strong>OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN WHOIS.</strong> Your wilful provision of
inaccurate or unreliable information, your wilful failure promptly to
update information provided to us, or any failure to respond to
inquiries by us addressed to the email address of the registrant, the
administrative, billing or technical contact appearing in the Whois
directory with respect to a domain name concerning the accuracy of
contact details associated with the registration shall constitute a
material breach of this Agreement and be a basis for cancellation of the
domain name registration. Any information collected by us concerning an
identified or identifiable natural person (“Personal Data”) will be used
in connection with the registration of your domain name(s) and for the
purposes of this Agreement and as required or permitted by ICANN or an
applicable registry policy. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>21. <strong>REVOCATION.</strong> We, in our sole discretion, reserve the right to
deny, cancel, suspend, transfer or modify any domain name registration
to correct a mistake, protect the integrity and stability of the company
and any applicable registry, to comply with any applicable laws,
government rules, or requirements, requests of law enforcement, in
compliance with any dispute resolution process, or to avoid any
liability, civil or criminal. You agree that we shall not be liable to
you for loss or damages that may result from our refusal to register or
cancel, suspend, transfer or modify your domain name registration.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>22. <strong>INCONSISTENCIES WITH REGISTRY POLICIES.</strong> In the event that this
Agreement may be inconsistent with any term, condition, policy or
procedure of an applicable registry, the term, condition, policy or
procedure of the applicable registry shall prevail.</p>
<p>&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>23. <strong>NON-WAIVER.</strong> Our failure to require performance by you of any
provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such
performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by us of a
breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the
provision itself. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>24. <strong>NOTICES.</strong> Any notice, direction or other communication given
under this Agreement shall be in writing and given by sending it via
