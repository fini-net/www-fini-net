iReserve is a web application designed to manage professional and general liability claims. The design has melded the knowledge of insurance, information technology and human-computer interfacing experts to build a system which works the way you want it to, not the way it wants you to.

By using industry standard browsers (Internet Explorer, Netscape, and Mozilla) and Adobe Acrobat to access iReserve, little or no software installation is required on your computer. This also means that the same set of information can be viewed, manipulated, and analyzed by many users simultaneously regardless of geography, Internet connection speed, or operating system.

iReserve has been built with a variety of industry-standard tools that have shown longevity, integrity, and ease of development. We would like to mention particularly these core technologies: Linux, !MySQL, Perl, and Apache. Relying on these open source technologies provides us unprecendented control over the internals of the application and the ability to resolve issues without external vendor conflicts. By using Perl as iReserve's core application development language, we can painlessly and seamlessly integrate iReserve with web services (including .Net and SOAP), XML, and proprietary SQL databases such as Oracle and Sybase.
