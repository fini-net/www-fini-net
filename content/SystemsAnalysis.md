## Systems Analysis

Systems analysis is the science dealing with analysis of complex, large
scale systems and the interactions within those systems.

The systems discussed within systems analysis can be within any field
such as industrial processes, management or decision making processes,
environmental protection processes etc. Systems analysis researchers
apply mathematical methodology to the analysis of the systems involved
to form a detailed overall picture.

The typical use of systems analysis is to guide decisions on issues such
as national or corporate plans and programs, resource use and protection
policies, research and development in technology, regional and urban
development, educational systems, and other social services. Clearly,
the nature of these problems requires an interdisciplinary approach that
FINI is uniquely capable of providing.
