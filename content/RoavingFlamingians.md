### Flamingians

Flamingo Internet Navigators is a small, independent research and
development house. We like to think of ourselves as "a little company
making a big difference".

For many years the birds now here at FINI roamed the land trying to
solve people's information technology problems. While uniquely suited to
this type of life, these birds found themselves increasingly frustrated
by the limitations of the legacy and Microsoft technologies being
deployed by organizations large and small.

We wanted to be able to do more, better, faster without the limitations
of sitting on the phone with product tech support for 14 hours trying to
figure out why a vendor's product wouldn't work in our environment.

We wanted to be able to offer solutions to people that worked, each and
every time, the way they wanted the software to work for them. So as
they say, "Birds of a feather flock together" and we all eventually
migrated to become Flamingo Internet Navigators!
