---+++Practical Security

---++++++Every day every computer network faces %RED%real threats%ENDCOLOR% in the %RED%real world%ENDCOLOR%.

Computer security is the effort to create a secure computing platform, designed so that agents (users or programs) cannot perform actions that they are not allowed to perform, but can perform the actions that they are allowed to.

It is important to understand that in a secure system, the legitimate users of that system are still able to do what they should be able to do. It has been said pejoratively that the only truly secure computer is one locked in a vault without any means of power or communication; however, this would not be regarded as a useful secure system because of the above requirement.

FINI's security professionals have been trained to think and act proactively in the sphere of practical security. Practical security takes the real world and the whole world, not just the defined system, into consideration when analyzing information technology systems.

While no system can be made 100% secure, (and anyone who tells you differently is just lying and you should tell them so) FINI confidently offers consulting and support for the following security issues:
