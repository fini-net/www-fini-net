## Systems Administration

FINI can provide remote systems administration.

System administration services include:

- Performing backups
- Applying any operating system updates, and configuration changes
- Installing and configuring any new hardware/software
- Adding/deleting/modifying user account information, resetting
  passwords, etc.
- Answering technical queries
- Documenting the configuration of the system.

- Troubleshooting

Let FINI remind you of how fun technology can be. Stop blaming yourself
for shoddy software and bug-ridden operating systems. Stop being a slave
to the machine and let the machine relieve your burden for awhile.
