### iReserve

iReserve is a web application designed to manage professional and
general liability claims. The design has melded the knowledge of
insurance, information technology and human-computer interfacing experts
to build a system which works the way you want it to, not the way it
wants you to.

By using industry standard web browsers
and PDF technology to access iReserve, no software
installation is required on your computer. This also means that the same
set of information can be viewed, manipulated, and analyzed by many
users simultaneously regardless of geography, Internet connection speed,
or operating system.

iReserve has been built with a variety of industry-standard tools that
have shown longevity, integrity, and ease of development. We would like
to mention particularly these core technologies: Linux, MySQL, Perl, and
Apache. Relying on these open source technologies provides us
unprecendented control over the internals of the application and the
ability to resolve issues without external vendor conflicts. By using
Perl as iReserve's core application development language, we can
painlessly and seamlessly integrate iReserve with web services
(including .Net and SOAP), XML, and proprietary SQL databases such as
Oracle and Sybase.
