### What Other's Are Saying About Platform Independent Enterprise Software

If we can't convince you of the viability of PIES over traditional
client/server technologies then please consider what others are saying.

Quoting [Reed Taussig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reed-taussig-790322/) from his October 16th article,
[Why client/server software giants will die out](https://web.archive.org/web/20050112030256/http://www.callidussoftware.com/callidus/news/99/10.17.html)

> So the question becomes this: As these client/server based companies
> fade, what will take their place?

> The answer can be found in the
> emergence of Internet-enabled systems being developed by a generation of
> newer, smaller, more agile, what might be called "business performance
> systems" companies. These differ from their client/server predecessors
> in that they are developing specialized, industry and solution-specific
> applications rather than giant omnibus programs that often take years
> and millions of dollars to implement.

> These new companies offer easy and
> quickly installed solutions for particular problems. They feature
> products that are easy to use, including an ability to be hosted
> off-site or easily downloaded onto a company's existing computer
> systems. Instead of taking years to get up and running, they can be
> brought online in weeks or months.
