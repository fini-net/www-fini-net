A cross-platform (or platform independent) software application works on
more than one system platform (e.g. Linux, Macintosh and Windows).
Cross-platform software is considered "portable" software.

#### Productivity through Portablility

The majority of proprietary software today is limited to a single
platform. In this model business productivity is severely limited unless
all of your computers run the same platform. Microsoft and other
proprietary software vendors engineer their products in this way to
maximize their revenue (which is great if you're a shareholder, but not
so great if you're the customer).

In the real world most companies have computers running several
different versions of the Microsoft operating systems, as well as
Macintosh and Linux. Workflow on any given project is often limited by
the physical contraints of how many computers run the software needed
for the given project.

Cross-platform software totally eliminates these physical contraints to
workflow. This leads to reductions in your physical and personnel costs
and greatly enhances productivity.

#### Combining Portability and Integration

Today, in addition to cross platform issues, most companies are focused
on application integration, which allows for workflow across
applications as well as across systems.

This focus highlights the need to move information through or across a
set of systems and components. Proprietary software solutions are not
engineered to allow integration (remember, they are engineered to
maximize the software companies revenue, not yours).

In fact, Microsoft Operating Systems and the proprietary software that
runs on them are engineered for obsolescence. This means that you have
to keep upgrading (buying ever newer versions) because the olders
versions are no longer supported. Microsoft's Windows 2000, while
wildly popular and widely deployed, is no longer supported by
Microsoft.

This ensures Microsoft and the like, repeating revenue from licensing as
you are caught in the cycle of perpetual upgrades, just to be able to
access and maintain YOUR data. So proprietary software companies
effectively hold your company's data hostage, while you repeatedly pay
them ransom.

#### Break Free From The Monopoly

FINI can free you from this extortion. FINI develops open source
applications that are cross platform and that allow for and encourage
the integrated use of other open source software applications. Imagine
being able to seemlessly move the same data through the various tasks of
word processing, spreadsheet/numeric tabulation, image manipulation,
etc. without ever paying another licensing fee! Proprietary solutions
just can't offer you that.
