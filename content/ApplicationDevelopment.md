- What does FINI do best?
- We make PIES!

### Platform Independent Enterprise Software

That's what we call our Linux server based software solutions.

PIES are [cross platform](CrossPlatform) applications that are housed on
a server, making them accessible to literally anyone using any type of
computer connected to the Internet. So how is this different from the
current client/server technologies? With client/server technologies the
user still has to have the software installed on their computer in order
to use it. With PIES, nothing ever has to be installed on the users
system.

PIES are secure and totally flexible. You have absolute control over who
can access your PIES, and what can be done with them.

We currently serve the following PIES:

- Customer Relationship Management
- Inventory
- Shipping and Fullfillment
- Point of Sale
- Sales Accounting and Reporting

We have several other PIES in development. Most importantly though, we
can develop PIES, inexpensively, for whatever your needs may be.

Now you're saying, "Yea, I've seen web software. Those cutesy JAVA based
games and applications that crash and take forever to load." Yep, we
have too. But those aren't PIES.

PIES are written totally in [Perl](http://www.perl.com/),
[JavaScript](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide),
[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), and our own web database engine,
FINIcase! PIES run on Linux. Combining these technologies can open the
door to significant time and resource savings, not only internally,
within your own organization, but externally with your vendors, dealers,
and business systems auditors. PIES can be used to perform all of your
business activities.

For most situations PIES can usually be developed within a few months.
If it is a case of merely adapting one of our current PIES to your
business practices that can usually be done within a few weeks.

PIES are unique so it is difficult to give general price estimates, but
we can tell you that many of our PIES cost less than $5000. That's
regardless of the number of users! That's with source code availability!
That's with installation and training!

There is never a charge for an initial consultation. So, don't hesitate
to call and discuss your needs with us.

## What can you do with PIES?

You do whatever you need to do with them! There are no bounds to the
kinds of PIES that can be made. Right now we have PIES that totally
replace the accounting, customer resource management, inventory, sales
and distribution software for companies with 20 - 10,000+ employees.
PIES can also be customized to your needs since they're so flexible.
Think about any business activity you can and we can develop PIES to
handle it for you. Payroll, accounts receivable and payable, training,
communications, you name it, no matter what kind of business you're in.

So now you're saying, there's no way my company could afford to invest
time or money in cutting edge software." Wrong. As we said, PIES are
much cheaper and faster to develop because the user-developer feedback
loop is continuous and there is no distribution overhead. PIES are
vastly easier to support so we don't have to pay hundreds of support
technicians just so you can use our PIES.

Updates to your software are done automatically without you ever having
to do a thing. In many cases updates to our software are free for the
life of the product. When you think about all those Microsoft licensing
fees, it doesn't take long to realize the kind of cost savings we are
talking about here.

Go ahead, break free of the monopoly and contact us to start benefiting
from PIES technology today.

If we can't convince you of the viability of PIES take a look at what
[others are saying](OthersSay) about this new technology.
