---++++ FINI Consulting

IT consulting is the process of helping companies to improve or transform themselves through or with their information technology. This may involve the identification and cross-fertilization of best practices, analytical techniques, technology implementations, strategy development or even the simple advantage of an outsider's perspective.

Consultants generally utilize formal frameworks or methodologies to identify problems or suggest more effective or efficient ways of performing business tasks and provide answers to the following questions that business executives grapple with every day of their working life.

   * How do we increase revenue?
   * How do we reduce expenses?
   * How do we increase productivity?
   * How do we bring in more customers?
   * How do we get more business out of each existing customer?
   * How do we increase shareholder value?

In regard to information technology, we at FINI amaze executives every day with our answers to these questions.
