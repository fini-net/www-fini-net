Microsoft may be a Monopoly, but being a commercial software vendor is
far worse. Do you hate Microsoft? Do you love Linux? Do you hate AOL? Do
you love Apple? Do you hate Apple? And why should any computer company
make this much emotional difference to anyone?

Because this technology matters. It can make your day to day life vastly
better. It can make tedious tasks interesting. It can make hard task
easy. It can turn sinking companies into rising ones. It can eliminate
distance in personal communications. It can free the blind and deaf from
their isolation.

But people don't talk about how technology has enriched their lives.
They ask "Why does my computer crash every day?" They ask "Why can't I
get on AOL?" They are frustrated in a very personal and real way.

There is a lot of software and hardware out there that is just poorly
built. The prevalent attitude is that it works "for most of the people
most of the time." It doesn't work for the consultant who is stuck away
from home and family for six months because of a stupid bug in Windows.
(That's me by the way.) It doesn't work for the your entrepreneur who
can't get his nightly faxes out to his clients because his fax software
hangs. It doesn't work for the mother who can't type letter without her
computer crashing.

This technology is becoming part of everyone's life. In the industrialized
world, it is thoroughly entrenched in most people's life.  These real people
and businesses matter. It is worth building computers and software not just
good enough, but well.

I hope that all that can help you see why U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's
[Findings of Fact](https://www.justice.gov/atr/us-v-microsoft-courts-findings-fact)
from Friday matters to me. Someone that is not a geek has finally looked beyond
their own stock portfolio.  There is some hope that the world will begin to see
beyond Bill's spin.  Within a few years I won't have clients say "I went with
the Microsoft solution so I don't have to worry about getting fired." Microsoft
will cease to be seen as a nice purveyor of software and will be recognized as
the biggest, clearest example of what we can't let happen to technology.

That's not news to me. It's not news to the legions of Linux and Mac
geeks out there. But it is news to many, many normal people. More people
will now see how it is. Hopefully those real people out there will sell
some of their Microsoft stock. Hopefully real people like yourself will
consider Microsoft's history of shoddy software when purchasing
computers and applications.

It would be nice if this were only Microsoft's fault. It isn't. Sadly
their standard pervades the technology industry. I've seen software
companies ax half of their Quality Assurance departments based on the
absurd logic of "we're making software that's too good".

What?!? Too good? I know I'd be willing to pay an extra $5 for a game
that was compatible with more stuff. I'd be willing to pay an extra $10
for software that I didn't have to install for my kids and mother.

Of course people are even happier to be able to save money while getting
software that actually works. And that is happening. Linux and open
source technology are spreading. Not a moment too soon. I've managed to
persevere through the dark Microsoft-dominated years of this business.
But many haven't. They've gone insane, become alcoholics, or turned into
writers. :-)

Linux is the beacon of what is to come. It won't be a utopia. And it
isn't a silver bullet. All of us have to work and make our own
contribution to writing code or documentation - or at least learning
about it. But we can now see how technology done well can make a
strongly positive difference in the lives of real people. It is a lot
less buggy so it causes a lot fewer sleepless nights. It is a lot more
efficient so you don't have to buy a new machine as often. It is secure
so it allows you to be effective in your personal vigilence to privacy.
In all, it represents the hope of the good that technology can be.

Given the increasing popularity and respect for Linux I don't know
whether Friday's
[Findings of Fact](https://www.justice.gov/atr/us-v-microsoft-courts-findings-fact)
and the likelihood of a ruling strongly against Microsoft will do anything more
than bring about the inevitable faster. But for those of us who have been
victims of shoddy software for years, moving beyond Microsoft can't happen fast
enough.
