the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.<p> 
<b>AGENCY</b>.&#65533; Should you intend to

liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages
resulting from the use or inability to use any of the Services or for the cost

loss of registration and use of your domain name, or for interruption of
business, or any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
kind (including lost profits) regardless of the form of action whether in
contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if we have been
advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall our maximum
liability exceed five hundred ($500.00) dollars.<p>

contained in the Dispute Policy.&#65533; When

Transferee") you shall require the Transferee to agree in writing to be
bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.&#65533; Your domain name will not be transferred
until we receive such written assurances or other reasonable assurance that the
Transferee has been bound by the contractual terms of this Agreement (such
reasonable assurance as determined by us in our sole discretion) along with the
applicable transfer fee.&#65533; If the
Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by us in our
sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such
transfer will be null and void.&#65533; You
acknowledge that you will not be entitled to change registrars during the first
sixty (60) days following the registration of your domain name.<p>

notice, describing the breach, to you.&#65533; If within thirty (30) calendar days of the
date of such notice, you fail to provide evidence, which is reasonably
satisfactory to us, that you have not breached your obligations under the
Agreement, then we may delete the registration or reservation of your domain
name. Any such breach by you shall not be deemed to be excused simply because
we did not act earlier in response to that, or any other breach by you.<p>

registration or reservation of your chosen domain name does not confer immunity
from objection to either the registration, reservation, or use of the domain
