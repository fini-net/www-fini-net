## Welcome to FINI

This is the home page for Flamingo Internet Navigators (FINI).

\<div class="indexbox"\> \<h3\>Because FINI knows...\</h3\> \<div
id="business"\> \<img src="%ATTACHURL%/business.jpg" alt="It's about
business." /\> \<h2\>it's about BUSINESS.\</h2\>

FINI knows it's about your business not ours. We don't try to make your
business fit into our software model. We make software to fit your
business processes and work flow. \</div\> \<div id="now"\> \<img
src="%ATTACHURL%/now.jpg" alt="It's about now." /\> \<h2\>it's about
NOW.\</h2\>

FINI knows that when you need a solution, you need it now. We require no
time commitments from you on a project and we deliver what you need,
when you need it. \</div\> \<div id="you"\> \<img
src="%ATTACHURL%/you.jpg" alt="It's about you." /\>

\<h2\>it's about YOU.\</h2\>

FINI knows that there is more to life than your IT needs and the
business cycle. We give you more of what you need to enjoy more of what
you really enjoy. \</div\> \</div\>

\<h3 style="border:none;"\>Rationale\</h3\>

FINI leverages the power of the open source model to create practical
solutions for existing information technology issues. Our goal in
software design is to make easy tasks easy and difficult tasks possible.
Our versatility permits the creation of solutions for varied computing
environments.

A recent example of FINI's ability to harness this flexibility and power
is evident in [iReserve](http://www.ireserve.info/), a technology
solution for medical malpractice claims management. iReserve is being
used today by companies such as Sentara, Eastern Virginia Medical School
and others. Please take a moment to [read more about
