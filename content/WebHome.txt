---+++ !! Welcome to our <nop>%MAINWEB% wiki. 
This is the wiki for Flamingo Internet Navigators (FINI).  Some of the information on this wiki is carefully controlled, but for the most part feel free to make contributions and suggestions. Thank you for taking some time to get to know us better.

<h2>it's about BUSINESS.</h2>

FINI knows it's about your business not ours. We don't try to make your business fit into our software model. We make software to fit your business processes and work flow.

<div id="now">
<img src="%ATTACHURL%/now.jpg" alt="It's about now." />
<h2>it's about NOW.</h2>

FINI knows that when you need a solution, you need it now. We require no time commitments from you on a project and we deliver what you need, when you need it.

<div id="you">

<h2>it's about YOU.</h2>

FINI knows that there is more to life than your IT needs and the business cycle. We give you more of what you need to enjoy more of what you really enjoy.

<h3 style="border:none;">Rationale</h3>

FINI leverages the power of the open source model to create practical solutions for existing information technology issues. Our goal in software design is to make easy tasks easy and difficult tasks possible. Our versatility permits the creation of solutions for varied computing environments.

A recent example of FINI's ability to harness this flexibility and power is evident in [[http://www.ireserve.info/][iReserve]], a technology solution for medical malpractice claims management. iReserve is being used today by companies such as Sentara, Eastern Virginia Medical School and others. Please take a moment to [[IReserve][read more about iReserve]].
